# Hospital Patient Data Analysis (Python)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital patient records to identify billing patterns,
disease distribution, and hospital stay duration using Python.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- CSV Dataset

## Key Analyses Performed
- Average hospital bill amount
- Patient count by disease
- Average hospital stay by disease
- Gender-wise total billing
- Top 3 highest billing patients
- Disease with the longest average hospital stay

## Visualizations
- Bar chart: Patients by disease
- Bar chart: Average stay days by disease
- Pie chart: Billing distribution by gender
- Bar chart: Top 3 highest billing patients

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Date handling and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Real-world healthcare data analysis
